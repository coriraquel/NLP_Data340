# [Dataset](https://github.com/ErikaJacobs/Harry-Potter-Text-Mining/tree/master/Book%20Text) Creation
##### Due date
##### March 20th, 2023

## Milestone description
Create a dataset to perform your analysis. 

## Objective
This assignment focuses on the explaination of the dataset I plan to use for my final project investigating the creation, preparation, previous modelings and documentation of the dataset. 

## Sources of the dataset 
##### a. Where did you get the data? 
   My dataset game from ErikaJacobs on GitHub
        
##### b. How did you get the data? 
   I downloaded this dataset from ErikaJacobs on Github.
        
##### c. What is the license of the data if any? 
   This data is licensed under Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) *(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)* meaning that I am free to copy, redistribute, remix, transform, or build upon the dataset for all uses including commercial usage.

##### e. Link to code used to create the dataset.

## Description of the dataset 
##### a. What is the size of the dataset? 
   The dataset is the text of all seven Harry Potter books in a text file.
        
##### b. What is the format of the dataset? 
   The format of the data is a text file. 
        
##### c. What is the structure of the dataset? 
   The data is structured by text. 

## Data models and data structures 
##### a. What are the data models used in the dataset?
   This dataset is unstructured since as of right now it is only a collection of sentences.
         
##### b. What are the data structures used in the dataset?
   Since this dataset is unstuctured there are not structures in it yet.

## Outcomes
   I plan to create a dataframe with book one then iterate through books two through seven to append those books to that dataframe. I would then use NTLK to clean the data before creating a dataframe that includes an index, the text, the chapter, the book, the word count text and the word count.
