The Problem
I need a list of relevant scholarly articles that relate to multiple topics of interest. I also need summeries of these text to decide what would be most useful to my research. For my project I am to create a NLP-based scrapper that will look throguh multiple scholarly articles and compile relevant text according to the topic of the users choosing. For my project I will be focusing on articles that explore game theory and medicine. 

Learning Objective: 
From this analysis I hope to learn how accurate titles and tags are in terms of the TF-IDF meaning. Evaluate/train the model to provide accurate summeries for all of the articles they are pulling. I also plan to have some sort of output feature that could provide summeries, citations, and links in some sort of downloadable document. 

Learner Growth: 
I am excited for this research topic simply because I have never done anything in NLP before. I have also never had an opportunity to build a tool within a data sciene class before. I want this to be useable for a user so that is my objective, I want to learn how to create code that is meaningful to the client side. 

Potential Questions: 
1. Do the tags/titles reflect some sort of relationship with the TF-IDF charts?
2. Is there a meaningful amount of data available related to the topic that interest me?
3. Can there be an interface for this project to make the user-experience easier? 
4. Can this code be updated to be used/applied to topics outside of the two I initially utilized? 

Timeline: 
Tuesday Feburary 21: Locate site that will be used for data extraction 
Monday Feburary 27: Initial webscraper of data site and investigation of data results 
TBD: data cleaning, next draft of questions based on data investigation, investigative coding, finalize questions, finalize coding plan, begin coding stage 1 

Outcome: 
TBD
