## The Problem:
The objective is to build a machine learning model to identify the most important sentences in a Harry Potter and use them to create an abstractive summarization of the chapter. The summary would then go through a language generator as a starting point for creating a short story that expands on ideas presented in the summary.The language generator would utilize a recurrent neural network to adjust the writing style to reflect more accurately with that of the book.   

## Learning Objective: 
From this project, I hope to train a model to provide accurate summeries for each chapter of all 6 Harry Potter books, create short stories with the language generator that accurately reflect the story and writing styles of the original books to the average reader, and export this data in a meaningful way to users.

## Learner Growth: 
I believe this project is a good mix of natural language processing techniques in the area of machine learning and neural networks that became of interest to me throughout the semester. I believe adding in the Harry Potter aspects grounds the project in creativity and fun as well as allows me to better analyze the results as I am well versed in the intial topics. However, I believe this has many applications outside of just Harry Potter. 

## Potential Questions: 
1. What percentage of accuracy is the model performing at when pulling important sentences for the summary? 
2. How is the model creating new original text based on the content of the model?
3. Can there be an interface for this project to make the user-experience easier? 
4. Can this code be updated to be used/applied to topics outside of how it was initially utilized? 

## Timeline: 
**Tuesday April 4:** Project planning, methodology, pseudo-coding, data collection and mentor approval/notes 

**Wednesday April 5:** Data cleaning and preprocessing removing unnecessary characters, punctuation and stop words utilizing NLTK

**Thursday April 6:** Begin text summerization model by looking into abstractive summerization techniques and learning about models such as GPT-2 and BART 

**Friday April 7-Friday April 14:** Test and modify text summerization model to recieve highest accuracy score possible while making adjustments for overfitting and outliers. 

## Outcome: 
TBD
